    <h1>Welcome to Shuyu's Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Scroll through the following pictures of recent projects! Sorry it's still a work in progress... I only just made this! If you check back in a few weeks it'll be much nicer (probably) :)</p>
    <img src="CGEM Telescope Materials/CGEM1.jpg" alt="Telescope" width="450" height="300">
    <p>The UBC-NASA CGEM Telescope on a very clear night this summer.</p>
    <img src="CGEM Telescope Materials/EncoderEthernet1.jpg" alt="Encoder" width="450" height="300">
    <img src="CGEM Telescope Materials/EncoderEthernet2.jpg" alt="Encoder" width="225" height="300">
    <p>I designed the system collecting pointing data (both azimuth and elevation) for the telescope. Pictured is a rig for the azimuthal encoder that is connected through RS-485 (differential signaling) SPI to an STM32 H723ZG microcontroller, on which I implemented FreeRTOS and a custom UDP Ethernet socket. The data queried from the encoder is sent via optical fibre, switch, and ethernet cable to a computer near the telescope mount. Notice that the box containing the microcontroller is shielded to prevent RF leakage (why? Lol because it's a Radio telescope) </p>
    <img src="LTRI Neuroscience Research Materials/CaTrackerOverview.jpeg" alt="App" width="600" height="400">
    <p>I co-built CaTracker software, which uses a LSTM neural network to track neurons in calcium-imaged videos and correlate specimen behaviour with neural activity. I independently built a simple GUI for this software (and yes -- I drew those pink cats!)</p>
    <img src="Burger Robot Materials/BurgerRobot1.jpg" alt="Robot" width="250" height="300">
    <img src="Burger Robot Materials/BurgerRobot2.jpg" alt="Robot" width="250" height="300">
    <p>Here's a picture of our burger-making robot (named "Bernadette") from after the competition (I'll add a video of it performing soon as well, once I find it). You can see that it features two encoded arms that used deconstructed vacuum cleaners to pick up food objects. There also is a lot of wiring... Mainly because of how many sensors (encoders, IR sensors, limit switches, counter recognition, line following, etc...) we had to connect -- and with Schmitt Triggers for almost all of them too! There are also three microcontrollers (STM Bluepill and two ESPs) at work here, communicating through Bluetooth and UART. </p>
    <img src="CGEM Telescope Materials/WormGearMotor1.jpg" alt="Motor" width="450" height="300">
    <img src="CGEM Telescope Materials/WormGearMotor2.jpg" alt="Motor" width="225" height="300">
    <img src="CGEM Telescope Materials/WormGearMotor3.jpg" alt="Motor" width="225" height="300">
    <p>Here is a mechanical setup I designed and built to validate a 20-bit absolute Hohner Encoder! It involved a motor with a worm gear that VERY slowly turned the encoder to make sure there were no missing bits.</p>
    <img src="ENPH353 Self Driving ML Materials/SimpleLineFollow.gif" alt="Line Follow GIF" width="225" height="300">
    <p>Here is a super simple line following example using foundational computer vision concepts implemented from scratch. Since then I've been working on using imitation learning and reinforcement learning to line follow in more complex 3D environments.</p>
    <p>MORE COOL PICTURES TO COME!!!</p>
    <p>Will put picture of: ENPH353 competition progress<p>
    <p>Will put picture of: Parkinson's medical aid device<p>
    <p>Will put picture of: autonomous neuron reconstruction pipeline (makes 3D model out of confocal microscope images, using ImageJ and algorithsm)</p>
    <p>Will put picture of: Binary Card Game (a Java project with save/load abilities)</p>
